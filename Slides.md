# Course Overview & Objectives
- **Goal:** Learn 2D/3D modeling using JavaCSG  
- **Focus:** Design Patterns & Transformation Operations  
- **Project:** Build a modular system for interlocking bricks  
  - Brick blueprints (fixed 3D-printed parts)  
  - Assembly with separately printed clickers  
- **Outcomes:**
  - Create 3D models from 2D shapes  
  - Apply design patterns effectively  
  - Utilize translation & rotation transformations

---

# Introduction to JavaCSG
- Provides immutable geometry operations for 2D & 3D  
- **Key Features:**
  - 2D operations: points, vectors, polygons  
  - 3D operations: extrusion, Boolean operations, transformations  
- **Design Note:** Every operation returns a new immutable object

---

# 2D Geometry Fundamentals
- **Primitives:**
  - Points & Vectors  
  - Angles  
  - Polygons (e.g., rectangles, circles)
- **Operations:**
  - Boolean operations: union, difference, intersection  
  - Convex hull

---

# From 2D to 3D Modeling
- **Linear Extrusion:**
  - Converts 2D shapes into 3D by extruding along the Z-axis  
- **Rotational Extrusion:**
  - Rotates a 2D profile around an axis  
- **Application:** Create fixed 3D bricks from 2D outlines

---

# 3D Geometry Essentials
- **Boolean Operations:**  
  - Union, Difference, Intersection in 3D  
- **Transformation Composition:**  
  - Combine multiple operations for precise positioning  
- **Focus:** Build models with fixed, 3D-printed brick types

---

# Click-System API Overview
- **Purpose:** Generate clicker-holes in bricks  
- **Key Methods:**
  - `getTurnHole()`, `getFixedHole()`, etc.  
- **Usage:**
  - Integrate clicker-holes into brick blueprints  
  - (Clickers are printed separately for optimal strength)

---

# Design Patterns in the Project
- **Factory Pattern:**
  - Create brick blueprints with fixed dimensions  
- **Composite Pattern:**
  - Assemble bricks and sub-models into larger structures  
- **Builder Pattern:**
  - Manage the multi-step assembly process  
- **Benefits:** Modularity, scalability, separation of concerns

---

# Transformation Operations
- **Translation:**  
  - Moving objects to specific positions  
- **Rotation:**  
  - Orienting objects correctly (e.g., aligning clickers with holes)  
- **Application:** Precisely place separately printed clickers into brick models

---

# Procedural Modeling Concepts
- **Parameter-Driven Design:**
  - Use parameters (width, height, depth) to dynamically generate models  
- **Example:**  
  - A parametric house model that respects print-bed constraints  
- **Benefits:** Flexibility and ease of adjustment

---

# Final Assembly & Integration
- **Project Integration:**
  - Combine brick blueprints with integrated clicker-holes  
  - Assemble multiple bricks into a composite model  
- **Key Focus:**
  - Accurate placement using translation and rotation  
  - Utilize design patterns for modularity  
- **Outcome:** A working prototype for final presentation

---

# Next Steps & Milestones
- **Group Exercises:** Apply learned concepts in hands-on sessions  
- **Milestones:** UML sketches, working demos, design documents  
- **Final Presentation:** Demonstrate the complete composite model  
- **Assessment Criteria:** Collaboration, design clarity, integration quality

---

# Q&A / Discussion
- Open floor for questions  
- Discuss challenges and potential solutions  
- Gather feedback on exercises and project integration
